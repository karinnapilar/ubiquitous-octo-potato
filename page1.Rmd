# Interactive plot
First let's make a ggplot of car, speed vs. distance

```{r carsggplot,fig.cap="A simple ggplot of car speed vs. distance"}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

ggplot(data=cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist, color=speed)) + geom_line() + geom_point(alpha=0.5)

```


```{r plotlycars, eval=FALSE}
ggplotly(
ggplot(data=cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist, color=speed)) + geom_line() + geom_point(alpha=0.5))

```
-*eval=FALSE is to show code, but not evaluate the code
-*echo=FAlSE/TRUE is to show or not the code

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

(two asterisc means bold and one  asterisc is italic)

```{bash}

```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#echo=False, imply will not show the codes
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
